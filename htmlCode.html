         <p class="font">Now, you came a long way by reading this blog and it's time to write your first piece of code. Are you excited for it?</p> <br>

            <p class = "font"><b>Let's Begin....</b></p> <br>

            <p class = "font" style="padding: 5px;"><b>Step 1 - Create A New File In your Editor</b></p> <hr>
                
            <p class = "font">The first thing we're going to do is opening up our text editor and create a new document.</p> <br>
                
            <p class = "font">Once you have created your document and saved it by giving a nade like "myFirstHTMLCode". Then there are some points you need to know:-
                <ol>
                    <li>
                       <p class="font">HTML document should always be saved with the .html file extention.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p class="font">The default homepage of a website is usually named as "index.html".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p class="font">You should only use alphanumerics (a-z, 0-9), dashes(-), underscores(_), or tildes(~) in the page name.
                       </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p class="font">You should always use lower case letter as some servers are case sensitive.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p class="font">You should never use spaces in the file/document name.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p class="font">It is good practice to create a naming convension and stick to it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p> <br>

            <p class = "font" style="padding: 5px;"><b>Step 2 - Create A Basic HTML Template</b></p> <hr>

            <p class = "font">Now, we're going to create a basic HTML template that you can use for any future HTMl documents as it remains same in every HTML document. We are going to add four elements which are - DOCTYPE, html, head and body.</p> <br>

            <img src="img/htmlTemplate.png">

            <p class = "font" style="padding: 5px;"><b>Step 3 - Add A Page Title And Practice Some Indenting</b></p> <hr>

            <p class = "font">The next thing we are going to do is to add a title to our page.
                Indenting an element simply means moving it one step to the right. The reason we are doing this is to make our code easier to read. Now after adding title and indentation our document will look like this:
            </p> <br>

            <img src="img/title.png">

            <p class = "font" style="padding: 5px;"><b>Step 4 - Add Headings And Preview In The Browser</b></p><hr>

            <p class = "font">Now, it's time to start adding some content in the body of our HTML document.</p><br>

            <p class = "font"><b>Headings are very important. As they define the structure of your document. Search engines use headings to index the structure and content of your page. If you don't use headings in an appropriate manner it may be harder for people to find your page when they use a search engine.</b></p> <br>

            <p class = "font">Basically, there are many tags for displaying the text as heading like("h1, h2, h3, h4..."). The thing you should remember is smaller the number larger the heading as h1 tag shows the largest heading h2 tag shows the heading comparitively smaller than h1. You can understand this by seeing below code and its output.</p> <br>

            <img src="img/heading.png">

            <p class = "font">Now, for previewing it's output on the browser you can simply click the "GoLive" button present in the bottom-right corner of VS Code or you can right click and from the given options you ca simply select "Open With Live Server" option.</p> <br>

            <p class="font">Now your output will look like this</p><br>

            <img src="img/html-heading-output.png">

            <p class = "font" style="padding: 5px;"><b>Step 5 - Using Image tag</b></p><hr>

            <p class = "font">The most fascinating and attractive thing on every website is images. So, now here is how you can add images to your webpage.</p><br>

            <p class = "font"><b>Firstly write img with angle brackets and your image tag is created. Now put the source of the image which you want to be displayed on the browser in src. Your code will lokk like this</b></p> <br>

            <img src="img/imgHtml.PNG">

            <p class = "font">Now we have given height and width also to this image. So your output will look like this.</p> <br>

            <img src="img/img.PNG">

            <p class="font">After completing this blog, you should have a overview of how to code with HTML.
            Now you can write your code and explore more about HTMl and other frameworks of web dev as well. The next step for you is to practice more and more and make amazing websites.
